My C# Final Project - OOP ECommerceSystem
Hey! This is my final project for my Object-Oriented Programming course, built with C#. I created this console application to practice and demonstrate everything I learned about core OOP principles.

üìú About The Project
I've always been interested in how e-commerce systems work, so I decided to build my own mini-marketplace. This app simulates a simple environment where buyers and sellers can interact. Users can register, sellers can list products for sale, and buyers can add them to a shopping cart and check out.

The most important goal for me was to build this with a solid OOP foundation. Every part of the system‚Äîthe User, the Product, the ShoppingCart‚Äîis its own class with its own responsibilities.

‚ú® What It Can Do
User Management: I implemented different user roles. You can sign up as a Buyer or a Seller, and the system will give you different options depending on your role.

Product Management: Sellers have the ability to add new products to the marketplace. Anyone can browse the available products.

Shopping Functionality: Buyers get a personal ShoppingCart they can add products to. I also built a simple Checkout process to finalize the purchase.

Object-Oriented Design: This was the core of the project. I focused on:

Encapsulation: To make sure each class's data is kept safe.

Inheritance: I used a base User class and extended it into Buyer and Seller.

Polymorphism: To make my code more flexible.
